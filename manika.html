                     <h5>What Is NavGurukul?</h5></div>
            
 
                <p>Founded in 2016 by graduates of Harvard and IIT-Delhi, NavGurukul is a not-for-profit organization
                    with a mission to create access to aspirational careers for students from marginalized
                    communities.Our flagship residential program runs on fully funded 18-month courses in programming,
                    finance, business & design.

                    Currently, we are empowering 1145+ students in our fully funded seven residential centers across
                    various states in India. So far, we have placed around 830+ students with tech and non-tech jobs in
                    various IT companies, Small-medium enterprises, and product startups.

                    NavGurukul is named after the blend of 'new' (Nav) and (Gurukul) meaning, the education system in
                    ancient India where shishya ('students' or 'disciples') lived near or with the guru in the same
                    house for a period of time. Our approach blends modern and traditional learning in a way that is
                    self-directed and uses student-centered learning strategies reminiscent of India's historical
                    educational systems.

                    Besides the residential program, we have digital initiatives such as Meraki and Zuvy.

                    Through Meraki, we work with students from government schools and ITIs through an online offering to
                    help students learn basic English, touch typing, and programming.

                    Zuvy is our digital initiative that aims to provide degrees through three modes: residential,
                    online, and day boarding. It supports students in getting the best jobs in the software industry,
                    with a strong focus on problem-solving, system design, and programming languages.

                  <p>Despite women comprising nearly half of India's population, only 19.2% of € N ing students are female, as reported by the All India Survey on Higher Education. -21 [1]. This stark disparity is even more critical as we navigate the fourth industrial revolution, which is set to create 60-65 million jobs in India's digital sector.2 At NavGurukul, we are committed to dismantling the economic, social, pedagogical, and access barriers that prevent women from marginalized communities from participating in this wave of opportunity. Our goal is to enable these women to achieve financial independence and exert social agency, which we believe will generate significant, measurable benefits for their families, society, and the nation at large.</p>
                  <p>Our work derives its strength from pillars of equity and empowerment with a major focus on Gender, Inclusivity, and Innovation.</p>
                  <p><b>#</b>We ensure that over 90% of our seats in our residential campuses empower young women, driving change where it's most needed.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>#</b>65% of our team members are NavGurukul Alumni handling various responsibilities across campuses and other remote functions.</p>
                  <p><b>#</b>Over 67% of team members are women, including non-binary members.</p>
                  <p><b>#</b>With our digital initiatives like Samyarth, our objective is to shift economic opportunities that are designed to be more equitable.</p>

                </div>
                  

                  <p>NavGurukul envisions an equitable future where every student has access to quality education, especially those from the bottom of the economic pyramid. We believe in fostering agency among our students, enabling them to chart their own professional paths while actively working to dismantle financial, gender, and social barriers that hinder their progress.

These graduates will work towards establishing permanent peace in the world. They will act as Ambassadors of Peace wherever they live, work and raise their families.

                    well, unlessit is amalgamated with spiritual education”. Throughout his journey, he
                    could effectively translate the visions of Sant Baba Attar Singh Ji (Mastuana wale) and
                    Sant Baba Teja Singh Ji by establishing the first Akal Academy in 1986 at Baru Sahib. Later,
                    it spread to a network of 129 CBSE affiliated Akal Academies over six states and two
                    Universities to impart value-based education from nursery to Doctorate level. As part of the
                    vision, prophesy and prayers of the visionary Saints, Eternal University was established
                    under the Himachal Pradesh State Act No. 3 of 2009 which has been recognized by UGC,
